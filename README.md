## Challenges
The largest challenge for this assignment was the limitation of using a Desktop Windows computer. Although I have access to multiple computers, most of them run Linux and my daily driver has been a Macbook for the past year. I tried getting a virtual machine working on these computers, but it was very slow and hard to work with. Even when I borrowed a friend's Window's laptop, I couldn't get TwinCat running on the machine because it didn't have Hyper-V support since it was running Windows 11 Home Edition. Fortunately, I was able to get TwinCAT running natively on a Desktop computer, but this option didn't give me much time to work on the assignment because I'm on-campus for most of the week.

Another challenge was the learning curve for many of the widgets in TwinCAT. Some of the commonly used widgets would have tons of documentation online and work as expected on the first try, but other widgets were harder to integrate and debug. For example, I tried getting a line graph to monitor the pressure over time, but I couldn't get the data to display on the graph. I tried following different tutorials, reading the documentation, and messing around with different inputs to no avail.
