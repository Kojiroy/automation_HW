## Overview
- Basic UI
    - The colored status textbox on the top left indicates what state the main loop is in. It can be in five possible states: IDLING, PUMPING, E_STOPPED, LEAK, and MALFUNC (short for malfunctioned). If the program gets into E_STOPPED, LEAK, or MALFUNC, the textbox should turn red. Else, the textbox should be green, indicating that things are nominal. 
    - If the user clicks on the E_STOP button on the top right, both the pump controllers and the pumps themselves would be forced off. The only way to re-enable the pumps is to click the reset button on its right. Once the reset button is clicked and the user verifies that things are nominal again, the program will go back to idle and wait for the user to start the pump controller again.
    - A leak, E-STOP, or broken pump status would make the pumps and their controllers shut down.
- General Page
    - The general page has all of the essential buttons and information that users will need for the majority of the time. The Start/Stop toggle switch will turn the controller on and off. This is there in case the user needs to disable the controller and  
- Analysis Page
    - Uses a historized symbol of nPressure so that we can keep track of the pressure over the past 10,000 seconds. This can be extended for real-world implementation. 
    - Pausing the trend graph will let you see the individual data points, and clicking the data points will tell you the pressure value and time it was captured (to the milliseconds).


For this assignment, I wasn't sure how to connect the Kuka To simulate the pump and pump sensor, I created a simple function block called FB_SimulatedIO, which increases the global variable "nPressure" by 0.01 if "bPump" is true and decreases it by 0.001 if it's false. There numbers are likely exaggerated from what would occur in real life, but this was done to test for edge cases more frequently. This does also mean that some of the safety features like leak detection and pump malfunctioning are untuned, but fine-tuned parameters for these features should be found through practice anyway.

Within the code, I purposely decentralized the pump controller from the pump relays because I wanted to make the code modular for various types of controllers. I hope I made this apparent with my implementation of both the simple pump controller and the PID pump controller. The key difference in output between the PID pump controller and the simple pump controller is that the PID pump controller assumes that we have full control of the valve while the simple pump controller assumes the valve is only either open or closed. 

For this assignment, I'm looking for a leak by seeing if it the current pressure has decreased by a certain hysteresis value while the pump is on. While not the most effective approach, with some fine tuning of the hysteresis, I believe that this could be a valid software-approach for a leak detection program. To check whether the pump is broken, I check whether the pump has increased less than a certain threshold over 5 consecutive cycles of the pump being on. If this is the case, then the pump can be deemed too inefficient or slow for the needs of Machina. 

Finally, for the extra credit, I created a function block called KukaRobot that sends either 16#00000000 or 16#00000001 to the output DWORD 0 connected to the Kuka Robot depending on whether the program detected a leak. I'm assuming here that the first bit of io that the robot receives is dword[0], but if it isn't, then we can simply make the latter 16#10000000. From my understanding, linking the output variable from the PLC program to the device's Module 3 (default IO) output should be enough to make the robot understand that there has been a failure with the pump.

## What I Did Well
Under the time constraints that I had, I believe that I learned and accomplished a fair amount. I think that things could have definitely gone smoother, but overall, I'm satisfied with the end product.

## Challenges
The first difficulty that I faced was trying to simulate the I/O of the EtherCAT device in my TwinCat Project. I wanted to use the same I/O variables that were used in the device for my project for ease of integration to the actual hardware. But I couldn't find documentation online nor was I successful after an hour of trial and error. So instead, I ended up creating a function block that simulates the pressure sensor and pump.  

The largest challenge for this assignment was the limitation of using a Desktop Windows computer. Although I have access to multiple computers, most of them run Linux and my daily driver has been a Macbook for the past year. I tried getting a virtual machine working on these computers, but it was very slow and hard to work with. Even when I borrowed a friend's Window's laptop, I couldn't get TwinCat running on the machine because it didn't have Hyper-V support since it was running Windows 11 Home Edition. Fortunately, I was able to get TwinCAT running natively on a Desktop computer, but this option didn't give me much time to work on the assignment because I'm on-campus for most of the week.

Another challenge was the learning curve for many of the widgets in TwinCAT. Some of the commonly used widgets would have tons of documentation online and work as expected on the first try, but other widgets were harder to integrate and debug. For example, I tried getting a line graph to monitor the pressure over time for almost an hour, but I couldn't get the data to display on the graph. I tried following different tutorials, reading the documentation, and messing around with different inputs to no avail. Eventually, I found out that I was missing the axis name for the variable through trial and error.

I also faced difficulties trying to get the HMI to update correctly. For instance, something that I spent a while on was making sure that the colors changed when an action happened. Although this sounds trivial, I spent a decent chunk of my time doing this because I believe that a good HMI should be one that a user can look at with a glance and understand how the overall system is operating. And simple colors like red and green are very efficient ways to communicate this. Regardless, trying to implement this turned out to be more difficult that I anticipated because there are many ways to set the background color of widgets, and I wanted to be as consistent in my implementation as possible. That's why I ended up using Themes and classNames for each of the primary colors, Javascript for reading and setting PLC variables to give me more flexibility, and structured language to change the colors of the widgets because the UI is intuitive and easy to use. Even with this approach, I still have some bugs like the Status Textbox starting out Red rather than green, which only changes to green after a reset.

## What I would do Differently
I would like to optimize the UI to be more user friendly. So for into the assignment, I focused on creating an MVP that's safe enough for a prototype and has many of the features that would be useful for debugging, but it isn't made to be super intuitive or easy to work with. I think that simple things like color-matching would go a long way for this project. 

With more time, I would have liked to refine the controller system and HMI for it. For this assignment, more complex controllers like a PID system isn't practical because of the simplicity of the model in simulation. Still, in real-world applications, being able to dynamically tune the PID parameters could have made finding the correct constants significantly easier. Being able to do this and other things like dynamically change the controllers was my original goal for the config page, but I ran out of time.

The last thing that I wanted to try out with the software was tuning the cycle time. Since this is a RT machine, I wanted to try optimizing the time complexity of the program and decrease the runtime for each task. Although I feel like the cycle time could be dependent on the other devices in the field bus, it would still be good to see how much headroom the program has between tasks.

In terms of how I would improve the hardware, I would use other sensors like current sensors or pressure sensors to help gauge how efficient and healthy the pump is. If the pump has worse efficiency compared to its peers or in the past, it might mean that it has hit an obstacle or has gotten too worn for its previous use-case.
